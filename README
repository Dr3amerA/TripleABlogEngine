A changed the application.property entry:
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create

This link fills up the database with all the data
http://localhost:8080/filldb?code=AAA
I could not do it from Test, so I created a new interface (FillDatabase), and implemented it
to do the job.

And this link shows our blogspot in its current phase
http://localhost:8080/blogspot

I think we have problems with database relations.
In the  public void createTestData() method I had to insert data into
user_posts
user_comments
post_comments
tables, they were not following the tables they link.

And probably the ManyToOne relationship between Post and USer and between Comment and USer is
not OK, that is why in blogspot.html I cannot change post.creatorID to post.user.username, and
comment.userID to comment.user.username. The user is null in these cases.
